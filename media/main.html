                                <p>As with many good things, gamification can be used in dangerous ways as well. Being a tool to affect thinking and decision making, gamification can have serious effects if used to take advantage of workers, control and mollify societies, or encourage dangerous or illegal behavior. One of the most prominent examples of gamification comes from China, where plans for implementing a gamified “social credit system” are already underway. This system keeps track of how “good” a person is, and assigns them a credit-like score. Based on this score, citizens are either punished or rewarded. Punishments include things like being barred from domestic flights, slowed internet connection, and inability to work in certain companies. Rewards on the other hand, range from discounts on energy bills and better interest rates at banks, to increased matches on dating sites. Points are added or detracted by performing actions the government deems as positive or negative. For example, smoking in non-designated zones or jaywalking would detract points, and paying bills on time or following laws would add points.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>The implications a system like this has on society as a whole is troubling, but what is most troubling is how willing Chinese citizens have been to the implementation of the system. The program, which was announced in 2014, has already been implemented in some areas, where private tech companies or local governments control the system and track citizen behavior. In the four years that have passed since the announcement of the social credit system, many citizens say they have gotten used to monitoring their social values, and some say the system has already made them better citizens. Despite this, many human rights groups are worried about the potential of mass-control and the idea that basic rights like free-speech might be punishable offenses through the social credit system. The program is planned to launch in 2020, and the control of the system will be placed in the hands of the Chinese government.</p>
