                Introduction
            </h3>
            <p>
                When mass media discusses video games and interactive media, a common trend seems to appear. Usually some major event, whether that be the release of a new game or a national tragedy involving youth, will occur, and people start to discuss the topic of violence in media, and how it can affect the thinking of those who consume violent media. Most often those who do not consume interactive media and games believe that the content of said media has a direct correlation to the consumer’s behavior, but scientific studies tend to show that is not the case (Conditt, J). Nevertheless, it would be remiss to claim that the consumption of media of any kind has no effect on a person’s thinking and perception of reality. In fact, interactive media can have an immense effect, but in much subtler ways. Through tactics such as gamification and inherent bias characterization, non-engaging activities can become entertaining and stereotypes can be subconsciously reinforced. The unique relationship interactive media has with consumers can put said consumers at an increased risk of falling prey to propaganda of all kinds, but this relationship can also be used to affect positive change in society.
