                    <p>-Hello! My name is Benjamin Lincourt and I am a first year Game Design and Development student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I was born in Virginia, raised in Indiana, and Graduated in 2018 from West Lafayette Junior Senior High School. I hope to work in a game development studio after graduation, but I am also interested in the impact games have on the mental and emotional states of players, and because of this I have considered creating Indie games as a way of exploring this.
